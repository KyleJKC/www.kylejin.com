## Energy Test Review Sheet

### Enzymes

#### Enzyme Notes

**Enzyme Structure and Function** - their job

1. **What type of macromolecule is an enzyme?** (carbohydrate, protein, lipid, nucleic acid)

   - Protein

2. **What is the job of an enzyme?**

   - Speed up reactions by lowering the activation energy required for biochemical reactions.

3. **Activation Energy, Substrate, Active Site**

   - **How do enzymes work? How do they make reactions happen so quickly?**
     - Enzymes work by binding to substrates at the active site, temporarily forming an enzyme-substrate complex that reduces the activation energy needed for the reaction, thereby speeding it up.

4. **Draw and label an enzyme with a substrate, reactants, and products. Use the potato experiment and hydrogen peroxide and catalase as your example:**

5. **Factors affecting enzymes, denaturation**

   - **Name 4 factors that affect the rate of an enzyme:**
     - a. Temperature
     - b. pH level
     - c. Salt level
     - d. Concentration

6. **What happens if an enzyme is in an extreme environment?**

   - Denatures

7. **Explain the graph of pH and enzyme activity above:**

   - Every enzyme has its own ideal level of pH. When the pH is at the optimum level, the enzyme will act at a faster rate.

### Photosynthesis

#### Photosynthesis Notes

**Formula for Photosynthesis**

`6CO₂ + 6H₂O + sunlight → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂`
**Light Dependent and Light Independent Reactions**

- Light-dependent reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes and produce ATP and NADPH.
- Light-independent reactions (Calvin Cycle) occur in the stroma and use ATP and NADPH to synthesize glucose.
  d. **How can photosynthesis be measured?**
- By oxygen output, glucose production, or CO₂ uptake.

#### Photosynthesis Details

- **Step: Light Reaction**
  - Where it happens: Thylakoid membrane
  - Requires: Sunlight & Water, ADP, NADP⁺
  - Produces: ATP, NADPH, O₂
- **Step: Calvin Cycle (Light Independent Reaction)**
  - Where it happens: Stroma
  - Requires: CO₂, ATP, NADPH
  - Produces: Glucose

#### Chloroplast Structure

#### Molecules in Photosynthesis

- **ATP & ADP cycle**
  - ADP -> ATP (ADP is not charged, ATP is charged with energy)
  - NADP⁺ -> NADPH (NADP⁺ is not charged, NADPH is charged with hydrogen ions and electrons)

| Step                                      | Where It Happens   | Requires                         | Produces                  |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Light Reaction                            | Thylakoid Membrane | Sunlight & Water, 2 ADP, 2 NADP+ | ATP, NADPH, O2            |
| Calvin Cycle (Light-Independent Reaction) | Stroma             | 6 CO2, 18 ATP, 12 NADPH          | Glucose, 18 ADP, 12 NADP+ |

### Cell Respiration & Fermentation

#### Cell Respiration Notes

**Where Cell Respiration happens**

- In the mitochondria.

**When does fermentation occur?**

- When no oxygen is available for aerobic respiration.

#### Cell Respiration Details

- **Step: Glycolysis**

  - Where: Cytoplasm
  - Requires: Glucose
  - Produces: 2 Pyruvate, 2 ATP, 2 NADH

- **Step: Krebs Cycle**

  - Where: Mitochondrial Matrix
  - Requires: 2 Acetyl CoA
  - Produces: 6 CO₂, 2 ATP, 6 NADH, 2 FADH₂

- **Step: Electron Transport Chain**
  - Where: Inner mitochondrial membrane
  - Requires: O₂, NADH, FADH₂
  - Produces: H₂O, approximately 32-34 ATP

#### Molecules in Cell Respiration

- **NAD⁺/NADH cycle**

  - NAD⁺ is not charged, while NADH is charged with electrons and hydrogen ions.

- **FAD/FADH₂ cycle**
  - FAD is not charged, while FADH₂ is charged with electrons and hydrogen ions.
